# Welcome to my Writing Portfolio!

### Temporarily, my portfolio is being hosted on my Github since I'm working on a website transition. Over the years, I've acquired and progressed many of my skills, and I want this growth to be seen on my new portfolio site. 

### In the meantime, take a gander at some of the great blog posts I've written!

#### Tricks of the Trade 
#### "Tricks of the Trade" is a series I came up with at TimeForge (a time and attendance software company). Before working at TimeForge, I worked at several restaurants. While writing this series, I drew from my service industry experience and writing skills to create an advice column directed to the types of businesses that would use the TimeForge software.
